                <h3 class="milestone">The 1st Milestone:<i>Pong</i>:1972</h3>
            <p>The Creation of <i>Pong</i>:
            California entrepreneur Nolan Bushnell hires young engineer Al Alcorn to design
             a car-driving game, but since this is 1972, this was too ambitious for
             the time, he instead has Alcorn design a version of Ping Pong.
              The game was tested in bars in Grass Valley and Sunnyvale, California,
              where it proved very popular. Pong would revolutionize the arcade industry
             and launch the modern video game era.After the invention of <i>Pong</i>, the
            world of computer technology would forever change in the application and use of computer
            technology in the world of gaming.</p>

            <p>Atari releases its Video Computer System (VCS) later renamed the Atari 2600.
             The VCS was the first widely successful video game system,
             selling more than twenty million units throughout the 1980s.
             The VCS used the 8-bit MOS 6507 microprocessor and was designed to be connected
             to a home television set. When the last of Atari’s 8-bit game consoles were made in
             1990, more than 900 game titles had been released. The Atari 2600 is the first major step
            into the fresh new console market. Being quite the achievement and bringing more acessiblity
             playability to video games as during this time, you would have to have a computer to play
            any type of game, and this console introduced many people for the first time into video
            games.</p>

            <p>Since 1983, the American electronic game market had been depressed due to a 
            overabundance of poorly performing games and consoles. That same year, Nintendo released its
            Famicom gaming system in Japan. Renamed the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) when
            it was released in North America, the NES started to turn the tables of the fortunes
            of the American game industry. The system launched with eighteen available titles,
            and was largely responsible for turning Mario the Plumber into one of the most enduring
            characters in the history of video games.The NES is also one of those consoles that 
            carries a certain nostagia to the people, especially the children of that time, due to
            how important it is the gaming as a whole and many people remember and recognize the
            <i>NES</i> over the Atari 2600 because of it being better as a whole. A sure advancement
            in gaming technology.</p>
